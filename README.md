# Iris-Flower-Classification
Welcome to my Data Science Internship at CodSoft! In this repository, you will find a Iris Flower Classification Project that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. This project showcases my skills in Data Science, Python, matplotlib and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

In this Project, I have used a Iris Dataset to develop a model that can classify Iris flowers into Different Species Based on their Sepal_length, width, Petal_length, width. This Dataset is widely used for introductory Classification tasks.
